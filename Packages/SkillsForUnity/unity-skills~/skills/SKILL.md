# Unity Skills - Module Index

This folder contains detailed documentation for each skill module. For quick reference, see the parent [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md).

> **Multi-Instance**: When user specifies Unity version (e.g. "Unity 6", "2022"), call `unity_skills.set_unity_version("6")` before operations. See parent SKILL.md.

## Advisory Design Modules

These modules provide architecture and coding guidance. They are optional and should be loaded when the user asks for design advice, refactoring guidance, pattern selection, or better script quality.

| Module | Description | When To Use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| [project-scout](./project-scout/SKILL.md) | Inspect current project baseline and constraints | Before proposing architecture changes in an existing project |
| [architecture](./architecture/SKILL.md) | Overall mini-game/system architecture planning | Before creating lots of gameplay scripts or when defining module boundaries |
| [adr](./adr/SKILL.md) | Short architecture decision records | When tradeoffs need to stay stable across multiple turns |
| [performance](./performance/SKILL.md) | Unity-specific performance red-flag review | When reviewing hot paths, Update usage, allocations, pooling, scene lookups |
| [asmdef](./asmdef/SKILL.md) | Assembly boundary and dependency planning | When project scale justifies clearer compile-time boundaries |
| [blueprints](./blueprints/SKILL.md) | Minimal architecture blueprints for common mini-games | When starting a new small game or gameplay vertical slice |
| [script-roles](./script-roles/SKILL.md) | Decide class roles before code generation | Before batch-creating gameplay scripts |
| [scene-contracts](./scene-contracts/SKILL.md) | Scene composition and reference contract planning | When defining required scene objects, bootstrap, and validation |
| [testability](./testability/SKILL.md) | Testability and pure-C# extraction guidance | When deciding what logic should be isolated from Unity APIs |
| [patterns](./patterns/SKILL.md) | Pattern selection for SO, events, interfaces, pooling, states | When deciding whether a pattern is justified |
| [async](./async/SKILL.md) | Async and lifecycle strategy | When choosing between `Update`, coroutine, UniTask, timers, cleanup |
| [inspector](./inspector/SKILL.md) | Inspector-facing API and serialization guidance | When designing fields, attributes, validation, authoring UX |
| [scriptdesign](./scriptdesign/SKILL.md) | Script-level quality review | When generating or reviewing scripts for coupling/performance/maintainability |
| [xr](./xr/SKILL.md) | XR development workflow guidance | When setting up VR/AR interactions, teleportation, grab, or XR rig |

## Batch-First Rule

> When operating on **2 or more objects**, ALWAYS use `*_batch` skills instead of calling single-object skills multiple times.

**Example - Creating 10 cubes:**

```python
# BAD: 10 API calls
for i in range(10):
    unity_skills.call_skill("gameobject_create", name=f"Cube_{i}", primitiveType="Cube", x=i)

# GOOD: 1 API call
unity_skills.call_skill("gameobject_create_batch",
    items=[{"name": f"Cube_{i}", "primitiveType": "Cube", "x": i} for i in range(10)]
)
```
